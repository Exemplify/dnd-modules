# D&D Adventure Repository

Welcome to my collection of Dungeons & Dragons adventures! This repository is a compilation of various one-shot adventures and homebrew modules I have created. Perfect for DMs looking for new stories to bring to their table or for players seeking inspiration for their next character.
Everything is designed for 5th Edition but feel free to manipulate it as you see fit. The repositiory is still being built up so not everything is available yet.

3. _Create a Pull Request:_ Submit a PR with a description of your additions or changes.
4. _Review:_ I will review the PR and merge it into the main repository.
