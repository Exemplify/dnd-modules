# D&D Adventure Repository

Welcome to my collection of Dungeons & Dragons adventures! This repository is a compilation of various one-shot adventures and homebrew modules I have created. Perfect for DMs looking for new stories to bring to their table or for players seeking inspiration for their next character. 
Everything is designed for 5th Edition but feel free to manipulate it as you see fit. The repositiory is still being built up so not everything is available yet.

## Repository Structure

- *One-Shots/*: This directory contains standalone adventures that can be played in a single session. Each one-shot is in its own folder, complete with all necessary materials.
- *Homebrew Modules/*: Here you'll find longer, more detailed adventures and campaign modules. These are great for extended play and offer deeper storytelling and complex character development.
- *Character Sheets/*: Customized character sheets and templates, suitable for various play styles and experience levels.
- *Maps/*: A collection of battle maps and world maps to enhance your gaming experience.
- *NPCs/*: Detailed descriptions and backgrounds for Non-Player Characters (NPCs) to populate your adventures.
