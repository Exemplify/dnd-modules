**Name:** Elara Thorne

**Age:** 17 years

**Appearance:**
Elara is a petite young woman, standing at just over 5 feet tall. She has short, mousey brown hair that falls in a choppy, practical style, just above her shoulders. Her eyes, a striking shade of hazel, often reflect a mix of resilience and underlying sadness. Her attire is simple yet well-kept, consisting of a worn tunic and trousers, suitable for someone who has to manage both household duties and work to support her family.

**Background:**
Elara has been a pillar of strength in the small community of Ember Hollow since the tragedy that befell her family. Her parents were victims of an orc raid that left many in the village devastated years ago. Since then, Elara, only a child herself at the time, took on the monumental task of raising her younger sister, Lila.

Despite her youth and the hardships she faced, Elara grew into a responsible and beloved figure in the village. Known for her compassionate nature, she often helps her neighbors with chores and is always ready to lend a sympathetic ear. However, the loss of her parents at such a young age has instilled in her a fierce protectiveness over Lila, making the current situation all the more agonizing for her.

**Personality:**
Elara is known for her kindness and tenacity. She's not one to back down from a challenge, a trait that has earned her respect among the villagers. Her love for her sister is her driving force, and she would go to great lengths to ensure Lila's safety and happiness. This deep-seated love is what drove her to the desperate act of stealing from the mayor, a decision that reflects her courage and the lengths she would go for her family.
