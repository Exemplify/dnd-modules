**Name:** Mayor Horace Grimwald

**Age:** Late 50s

**Appearance:**
Mayor Grimwald is a portly Dwarf with a commanding presence, standing at around 4 feet tall. He has a neatly trimmed grey beard that outlines his strong jawline, and piercing blue eyes that seem to miss nothing. His clothing is always of the finest quality, often adorned with subtle but expensive jewelry, signaling his status. He carries himself with an air of authority and confidence.

**Background:**
Horace Grimwald has been the mayor of Ember Hollow for over a decade. Before his tenure as mayor, he was a well-known trader, dealing in rare artifacts and antiquities. It was during these years that he encountered a green hag, known for her collection of powerful magical items. Grimwald, with his charismatic and cunning nature, managed to outwit the hag, acquiring a particularly powerful amulet through a mix of deception and clever bargaining. He convinced the hag that the amulet was cursed and offered to take it off her hands as a favor, while in reality, he knew its true worth.

**Personality:**
Mayor Grimwald is seen by many as a stern but fair leader. He values order and discipline but is not without a certain charm that has won him many supporters. However, beneath this facade, he is a shrewd and sometimes ruthless individual, especially when it comes to protecting his interests and the town he governs.

**Mayor Grimwald's Ambition:**

- **The Quest for Power:** Before becoming mayor, Horace Grimwald was known for his ambition. He sought power and influence, and part of his plan was to ensure the prosperity of the land surrounding Ember Hollow.
- **The Pact with Sybilla:** Grimwald sought out Sybilla in the Whispering Woods, recognizing her as a powerful force connected to the land. He proposed a deal: Sybilla would use her powers to bless the lands near Ember Hollow, ensuring bountiful crops and growth, in exchange for a significant sum of gold each time.

- **The Greed Grows:** Over time, as Grimwald's ambitions grew alongside his rising status in the village, so did his greed. He observed Sybilla using the amulet, the Heart of the Forest, to bless the lands and realized the true source of her power.

- **The Theft:** Convinced he could wield this power himself and no longer wanting to pay for Sybilla's services, Grimwald devised a plan to steal the amulet. Under the guise of another payment meeting, he managed to distract Sybilla and made off with the amulet.

- **Sybilla's Wrath:** Upon realizing the theft, Sybilla was enraged. Not only had Grimwald broken their deal, but he had also taken the source of her power. Her connection to the forest began to wane, and she resorted to desperate measures, like taking the children, to force Grimwald to return the amulet.

However, the amulet is also bound to the Whispering Woods, the source of its power. Its removal from the vicinity of the forest has caused an imbalance, enraging the natural spirits and creatures within, and possibly linked to the recent strange occurrences and disappearances in Ember Hollow.
