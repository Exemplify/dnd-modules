**Name:** Sybilla

**Race:** Green Hag

**Age:** Unknown (centuries old)

**Appearance:**

Sybilla embodies the eerie and foreboding nature of a classic green hag. She has gnarled, greenish skin that mimics the moss and foliage of the Whispering Woods she calls home. Her eyes are a piercing yellow, glowing slightly in the dark, and her hair is a tangle of dark, leaf-like strands. Despite her fearsome appearance, there is an air of faded nobility about her, a remnant of the guardian she once was.

In her illusionary form, Sybilla transforms into 'Selene Everglade,' a striking human woman in her mid 30s with an aura of gentle grace. She has long, flowing chestnut hair and soft, emerald green eyes that seem to hold a hint of ancient wisdom. Her skin is flawlessly smooth, and she carries herself with a serene and dignified poise.

Selene is often seen wearing a long, flowing gown in shades of green and brown, adorned with subtle patterns that resemble leaves and vines. She has an ethereal quality about her, almost as if she's not entirely of this world.

**Background:**
To those she deceives, Selene Everglade appears to be a kind-hearted herbalist or healer who has a deep connection to the natural world. She speaks with a soothing, melodic voice and seems to exude an air of tranquility. Selene is known to offer help or guidance, playing the role of a wise and benevolent figure.

**Personality:**
Under this guise, Sybilla (as Selene) exhibits a warm and caring demeanor. She's patient, attentive, and seems to have a genuine concern for the wellbeing of others. This persona is meticulously crafted to lower the guards of those she interacts with, making her manipulations more effective.

**Role in the Story:**
As Selene, Sybilla approached Elara while she was out searching for Lila, exploiting her desperation to save Lila. She used this form to manipulate Elara into attempting to steal the amulet from Mayor Grimwald, playing on her fears and maternal instincts. This guise is key to Sybilla's plans and serves as a tool for her larger scheme.

**Background:**

Sybilla was not always the malevolent creature she is now. Centuries ago, she was a guardian of the Whispering Woods, appointed by the ancient druids. Her role was to maintain the balance between the natural world and the encroaching influences of civilization. The druids entrusted her with the Heart of the Forest, an amulet that enhanced her abilities to nurture and protect the woods.

As centuries passed, the solitude and the weight of her duty began to change Sybilla. She grew more isolated and resentful of the humans and other races that she saw as a threat to the forest. Over time, this resentment turned into a deep-seated bitterness, warping her into the green hag she is today.

**Personality:**

Sybilla is cunning and has a deep understanding of nature and its dark, wild aspects. While she can be vindictive, especially towards those she sees as threats to her forest, there's a part of her that longs for the days when she was a true guardian, working in harmony with the druids and the land.

**The Pact and Betrayal:**

Years ago, she struck a deal with Horace Grimwald, then a mere ambitious man seeking power. As part of the agreement, she used the amulet to bless the lands near Ember Hollow, but Grimwald's betrayal and theft of the amulet have left her weakened and desperate. She sees the taking of the children as a necessary evil to force the return of the amulet and restore her strength, as well as the balance of the Whispering Woods.
