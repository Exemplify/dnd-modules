**Name:** Grunthar

**Race:** Troll

**Age:** Not known, but he appears middle-aged for a troll.

**Appearance:**
Grunthar is a towering figure, standing well over 9 feet tall, with a bulky, muscular frame. His skin is a mottled green and brown, tough and leathery, with patches of moss and lichen giving him an almost camouflaged appearance against the forest backdrop. His eyes are a deep yellow, with a glint of intelligence that belies the common stereotypes of trollish brutishness. His hair is wild and unkempt, a mix of greys and dark greens, cascading down his back. His arms are long and strong, ending in large hands with sharp claws.

**Clothing and Accessories:**
Grunthar wears simple, rugged clothing made from animal hides and rough cloth. Around his neck hangs a crude necklace adorned with various trinkets and tokens heâ€™s collected over the years. He carries a large, gnarled club, more as a symbol of his role as a bridge guardian than for use in combat.

**Personality:**
Contrary to the typical fearsome nature of trolls, Grunthar is surprisingly articulate and enjoys engaging in intellectual challenges like riddles and puzzles. He has a somewhat philosophical outlook on life and takes his job of guarding the bridge seriously, though he prefers to test the minds of travelers rather than engage in physical confrontations.

**Background:**
Grunthar has been the guardian of the bridge for many years, a role he took up after tiring of the usual trollish pursuits. He found he had a knack for riddles and logic puzzles, using them to challenge travelers instead of the traditional tolls or threats. His unique approach has earned him a reputation in the surrounding areas, and many travelers come prepared with their own riddles to challenge him.

**Role in the Story:**
In your campaign, Grunthar serves as both a challenge and a potential ally to the players. Successfully engaging with his puzzle can earn them safe passage and perhaps even additional insight or aid in their quest. Grunthar's unique personality and approach to life can add a memorable and enjoyable encounter in the adventure.
