**Name:** Judge Mabel Harrow

**Race:** Gnome

**Age:** 87 years (considered middle-aged for a gnome)

**Appearance:**
Judge Mabel Harrow is a gnome with an impressively tall hat that seems to add a foot to her otherwise modest height. She has twinkling, keen eyes behind round spectacles and sports a meticulously groomed silver beard, a distinctive trait among female gnomes of her age. Her robes are always impeccably neat, adorned with symbols of justice and wisdom.

**Background:**
Judge Mabel Harrow has served as the chief adjudicator in Ember Hollow for nearly four decades. Born into a family of scholars, Mabel was always fascinated by the laws and traditions that govern society. She studied extensively, both in Ember Hollow and in distant gnome cities, before returning to her hometown to serve its people.

Throughout her career, Mabel has earned a reputation for her sharp intellect, fairness, and a surprising sense of humor that often catches people off guard. She takes her role very seriously and is respected (and occasionally feared) for her no-nonsense approach to justice.

**Personality:**
Mabel is perceptive and wise, often able to see through deceptions and half-truths. She values honesty and integrity, but she's also empathetic and understands the complexities of life in Ember Hollow. Despite her stern exterior, she has a soft spot for the townsfolk and genuinely cares about their well-being.

**Role in the Story:**
As the judge overseeing Elara's trial, Mabel is torn between the law and her sense of justice. She must navigate the complexities of the case, the town's politics, and her own principles. Her decisions could significantly impact the course of events and the fate of the characters involved.
